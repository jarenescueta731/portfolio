# Portfolio
Class 301d15 portfolio assignment

## User Stories: MVP

#### Class-01 Responsive Mobile-first Design
- As a developer, I need my site to use valid & semantic markup, so that employers love me.
- As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
- As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
- As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.

#### Class-02 jQuery and the DOM
- As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
- As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.

#### Class-03 jQuery and Events
- As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
- As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

#### Class-04 Templates
- As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.

#### Class-05 (peer review)

#### Class-06 AJAX and JSON
- As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
- As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.

#### Class-07 Functional Programming(bonus)

#### Class-08 Intro to SQL (no assignment)

#### Class-09 Joins and Relations (no assignment)

#### Class-10 (peer review)

#### Class-11 Single-Page App
- As a developer, I want to convert the portfolio into a SPA using the page.js library, so that clicks on the nav modify the page rather than reload content from the server.

#### Class-12 REST and API's
- As a developer, I want to create a controller that includes a call to the GitHub API and renders parts of the returned content to the page once the data has been loaded.

#### Class-13 Production Deployment
- As a developer, I want my portfolio to run in a development environment that closely matches production, so that I can reduce bugs related to infrastructure surprises.
- As a site owner, I want my site running on a robust hosting platform, so that I don't have to hire a sysadmin.
- As a developer, I want my secret tokens accessed only through environment variables, so that I can keep them secure.

## Stretch Goals

- As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.
- As a visitor, I want to see the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developer's recent work.
- As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me an idea of how many days ago something was created.
- As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll through the whole list.
- As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
- As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.
- As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
- As a reader, I only want to have to fetch data when it's updated (and keep it cached locally), so that I don't make unneeded AJAX calls.
- As a developer, I want to refactor my code to use functional programming concepts where possible (using IIFEs, elimating for loops), so that parts of the app can be more loosely coupled.
